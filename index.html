<h2>Synonyms</h2>
<ul>
    <li><i>Luminosity of Stygian Transcendent</i></li>
    <li> LOST</li>
    <li> L.O.S.T.</li>
    <li> Project _Alpha 32_</li>
    <li> Project LOST</li>
    <li> Project 518</li>
</ul>

<h2>What is LOST</h2>
<p>Ok, if you are here and try to know what is LOST then you probably know me, am I right.
    So, see what lost is, but before that you must need to know these terms:</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>Knowledge:</i> Any information that help you to do something or make you happy.</li>
    <li><i>Word:</i> Any work done by you that uses *knowledge* or make you happy.</li>
    <li><i>Beauty:</i> Anything that help in doing the work easyly and confortable or make you happy.</li>
    <li><b>Happiness</b>: `Happiness = (Knowlege+Work)*Beauty`</li>
</ul>

<p> Now you are able to understand what I mean by LOST. But before that you shall know that this project will not be
    open-source. Now see, Lost is also `(Knowlege+Work)*Beauty`, means it is like happiness. Anyways, Lost is a 3d
    open-world progration-based mysterious game.
    I am currently working on it. The game is based on a special theory that only I know. </p>

<p> The only drawback in this is that it is only for <b>desktop</b>. </p>

<pre>
Mathemetically:
LOST ≈ Happiness ≈ (Work+Knowledge)*Beauty
</pre>
